# Quantitative description

The SQLite file was last modified on `r sqlite_file_last_modified`.
Other relevant start/end dates are shown in the table below.

```{r}
dates_to_present = tribble(
    ~variable, ~from, ~to,
    "Applications (submitted)", min( application_submitted_range ), max(application_submitted_range),
    "Applications (approved)", min( application_approved_range ), max(application_approved_range),
    "Workspaces", min(workspace_creation_range), max(workspace_creation_range),
    "Jobs (start)", min(job_start_range), max(job_start_range),
    "Jobs (end)", min(job_stop_range), max(job_stop_range),
    "Releases", min(release_range), max(release_range)
)
kable( dates_to_present )
```

## Overview: numbers of organisations, projects, copilots etc

```{r}
copilot_list = copilots %>% pull( copilot_name ) %>% unique()
num_copilots = copilot_list %>% length
```

We have `r num_copilots` active co-pilots:

```{r results='asis'}
cat(paste('-', copilot_list %>% sort), sep = '\n')
```


```{r}

external_users = external_users_on_projects_table %>% left_join(
    users_and_organisations, by="user_name"
) %>% filter( ! type %in% internal_organisations   )

returning_external_users = external_users %>%
group_by( user_name ) %>%
summarise( n_projects = project_id %>% unique %>% length )  %>%
filter( n_projects > 1 ) %>%
arrange( -n_projects )

```

We have `r external_users %>% pull(user_name) %>% unique() %>% length`
external users. `r returning_external_users %>% nrow` of these users
have worked on more than one OpenSAFELY project.

```{r}
column_name_map = list(

```

```{r}

projects_assigned_copilots = external_projects %>% filter( copilot_name != "None provided" )

num_projects_assigned_copilots = projects_assigned_copilots %>%
    pull( project_name ) %>% unique() %>% length()

external_releases = releases %>%
    filter( !is.na( release_created_at )) %>%
    filter( project_name %in% external_projects_list ) %>%
    ungroup( ) %>%
    mutate( specific_time_to_release = difftime( release_created_at, first_workspace_start_date ) )

```

Find some overall counts in Table \@ref(tab:overallcounts) below.

```{r}
overall_counts = tribble(
    ~count, ~n,
    "Total number of projects", num_projects,
    "Projects assigned co-pilots", num_projects_assigned_copilots,

    "Projects without outputs", num_projects_without_outputs,
    "Number of active copilots", num_copilots, 
   " Number of organisations with pilots", num_organisations

overall_counts %>%
    ### Format table
    flextable( ) %>%
    set_header_labels( values=list(count = "" ) ) %>%
    autofit() %>%
    theme_zebra() %>%
    footnote( i = 5, j = 1,
            value = as_paragraph("We have at least 1 former co-pilot that is not included in the list above"),
            ref_symbols = "a" ) %>%
    set_caption( glue( "Overall counts (as of {sqlite_file_last_modified})" ),
                autonum = run_autonum(seq_id = "tab", bkm = "overallcounts")) 

```


Projects may consist of multiple workspaces. A count of projects and workspaces per
organisation is provided in the Table \@ref(tab:numPKperorg).

```{r}

external_projects %>%
    ###Â Prepare data
    group_by( organisation_name ) %>%
    summarise( project_count = length(unique(project_name)),
                workspace_count = length( unique(workspace_name) ) ) %>%
    arrange( -project_count, organisation_name )%>%
    janitor::adorn_totals() %>%
    ### Format table
    flextable( ) %>%
    set_header_labels( values=column_name_map ) %>%
    autofit() %>%
    theme_zebra() %>%
    set_caption( "Number of projects and workspaces per organisation",
        autonum = run_autonum(seq_id = "tab", bkm = "numPKperorg")) 

```
